## Planning 

The vision was the create an app where users can search for recipes, save them and then create a meal planner for the week. 

For this we would require using a 3rd party JSON API ([Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/)) to fetch recipes, create a database to store users, recipes and meal plans and implement drag and drop to our meal planner board so that uses can move recipes around. 

We created a [wireframe](https://whimsical.com/seir63-meal-planner-app-NqDdWC24RS4W12V1d8fYeM) to draw out our plans.
