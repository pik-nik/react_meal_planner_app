## Search Results 
- Options to display in list or tile mode
- A maximum of 100 recipes are displayed at a time with 10 results per page using paginations due to the database size of the 3rd part API used, [Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/) which contains 2.3 million recipes.

- Users can then click on the recipe to show recipe details. 
    - As the API does not contain recipe method, a link is given to direct users to the original source.

- In order to access the "My Recipes" and "My Meal Plan" page users must sign up or log in.

## Planning 

The vision was to create a full-stack app where users can search for recipes, save them and then create a meal planner for the week. 

For this we would require using a 3rd party JSON API ([Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/)) to fetch recipes, create a database to store users, recipes and meal plans and implement drag and drop to our meal planner board so that uses can move recipes around. 

We created a [wireframe](https://whimsical.com/seir63-meal-planner-app-NqDdWC24RS4W12V1d8fYeM) to draw out our plans.

We used Trello, Whimsical, Slack and Zoom as collaboration tools to ensure effective communication across the team.
